                    We know that at this point of time where everyone is locked inside their houses and are not allowed to go outside (except for important purposes), we often 
                    feel bored and dont feel like doing any work. Well now is the time to do what you like and there is no one to distract you. Here are some of the things I 
                    did during this period. Now, I know that everyone was binging movies and series, listening to music, permanently dyestroying your sleep schedule(which I did),
                    well I'm here to talk about what all kind of priductive stuff i did during this lockdown session. Furtheremore I can't wait to go outside once this is over and enjoy
                    with my friends and family. So, here are some of the things I did during the lockdown.

                    This was one of the things which I needed to do for a long time. I was always intrested in cooking and also to help my mom. Since I was having a lot of
                    time to spare, I did some cooking. At first it was a bit hard, but then I gradually tried and now I could make some good food. At first I started learning
                    cooking by watching Youtube videos and reading some cooking blogs. It was a bit hard to understand some cooking terms. But thanks to the all mighty internet I 
                    was able to grasp it a bit fast. Additionally I also got some help form my mom. Then after some errors and some devastating accidents where I suffered some
                    injuries, I made my first dish. Atlest now I can make some food now and not stay hungry when there is no one at home :)

                    Some of my favorite dishes which I liked making are Paneer curry, Pasta Carbonara, Lo Mein and Buritto. Also I also learned to make cakes and cookies. 
                    These was some amazing times as I had a really good time doing it. I hope that I can pursue more of this.

                    I was always intrested in photography even though I'm more of an outside guy, I needed to use my camera after a long time. At this point of time, I tried
                    to do some indoor photography. Doing indoor photography is hard because the lack of lighting, properties and so on. But at the same time its also challenging.
                    Also, I was also kinda lazy to do it. Finding subjects to take a picture of was kind of hard. And also the added problem of lighting and the area. At first it was a
                    blt hard. But, with the help of the internet I was able to take some pictures. Some of my photography friends also helped me by giving me some good tips.
                    To be honest, they did give some good tips. Another main part of this is the editing part. This was more harder to do comparing it to taking the picture part.
                    Findint the right balance b/w the temperature, color and contrast of the image was a bit hard. Again for this I had to turn towards the internet. Seriously, without
                    it would had been a bit difficult. Well here are some of the pics which I took.

                    I did like doing it and I hope that I do get more time for doing it. If you did like some of this pics, do give it a like on Facebook or in Instagram.

                   I know that every person say that the do read books even though some of them lie. It is extremly difficult to read a book when you can access all of the 
                   world's entertainment using or laptops and mobile phones. Even though it is a bit difficult to do it, later it would become easy if you continue the habit.
                   Reading did really gave my eyes some time to heal after staring at the screen for a long time. Even though I like to movies and all, a little break can help a lot.
                   There were a lot of books which I had bought over my lifetime. Many of them left incomplete. Hence I madeit my objective to finish all of them. I was finding it a 
                   bit difficult to stick to the plan. But by willpower, I did manage to finish some of them.

                   Some of the books I read are The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway, The Lost World by Arthur Conan Doyle, Malgudi Days by R.K. Narayan, Inferno by Dan Brown, The Fault
                   in Our Stars by John Green, Wings of Fire by Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy and so on. Now i'm currently reading Farenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. Its a
                   really interesting book and I do recommend you all to read it.

                    And there it is, these are some of the many things I did during this lockdown. I also did other stuff like most people do like watch a ton of movies,
                    played a lot of games, listening to a billion number of songs, and so on. These were some of the productive activities I did. I only wanted to say that
                    if I, the most laziest person in this world can get some work done, so can you. Stay safe, be happy and watch out for your loved ones. :)
